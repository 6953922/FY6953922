           When engineers design a ship they need to make sure it moves smoothly thorugh water, without wasting feul or becoming unstable.
         But testing ship designs physically (in water tanks) in expensice and slow. 
         So instead, thye use CFD, which is a kind of computer simulation that shows how water and sir move around a ship's hull or propeller.
         Like a digital ocean: engineers use maths and physics to model how water flows, ow waves hit the ship, and how design changes affect 
         speed and resistance. This lets them tet hundreds of designs on a computer before building anything in real life.

       <pre>
         Around 60-70% of a ship's feul is used just to overcome water resistance (drag). 
         Even a 1% reduction in drag can save thousands of tonnes of feul every year.
         CFD helps design more efficient ships, hence, less feul feul, less pollution, and lower costs.

         It is also used to:
         Predict wave resistance and propeller performance, 
         Design eco-friednly hull shapes,
         Test stability and safety in storms or rough seas. 
         CFD is a simulation based approach to studying how water flows around a ship's hull.

<h1>How CFD works?</h1>
<p>Engineers divide the ship and surrounding water into tiny cubes called cells. Then they calculate how the water moves through each cube. 
  
  Examples of CFD applications:
  - Optimising hull shapes to reduce drag.
  - Desigining propellers for smoother flow.
  - Simulating ship performance under different sea conditons.
  - Simulating ship performance under different sea conditions. 
  Comparison: traditional tank testing vs CFD (cost, time, precision).
